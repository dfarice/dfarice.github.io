Hello world! I am James Lockard, currently a junior computer science major at Rice University. For this up coming fall semester, I will be one of the studio leads for the Rice chapter of Design for America. I joined DFA at the beginning of the 2013 fall semester as a project team member. The team was composed of Zach Carlins, Nicola Park, Lily Wen, Jesse Hellemn, and myself. My fellow teammates and I worked for the remainder of the school year on a map for Houston's homeless population. The map detailed key resources for those experiencing homelessness. Currently, the Houston Coalition for the Homeless is distributing the map as a part of their latest initiative, Coordinated Access.
