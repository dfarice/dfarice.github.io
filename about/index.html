        Design for America is a nationwide network of interdisciplinary student teams and community members using design to create local and social impact. DFA Rice is an extension of this network to Rice University. The Rice chapter was founded in 2013. Since then, we have strived for fostering an environment in which student of different backgrounds can work together towards creating a tangible impact. The design process we use places its primary focus on the user, on the people whose lives are directly impacted. The problems we try to fix are large, problems that Houston faces everyday, problems that a solution for would have noticeable impact. Topics DFA Rice has worked on include homelessness, education, and social anxiety.
